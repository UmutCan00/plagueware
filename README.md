# About Plagueware
The people of the town travel between different buildings based on the in-game time and the individual desicions of a person.
Each person has many variables that will affect the epidemic in different ways.
The virus has three variables: contagiosness, asymptomatic rate and mortality rate.
The variables of the people and the virus may change over time based on both the players choices and the natural flow of the game.
Plagueware has 3 game modes: Simulation, End-Bringer, and Savior.
# Simulation Mode
In this mode, you can watch the virus spread in an uninterrupted matter. The player does not have control over the variables of the virus or the people. 
Instead, the player can learn about the mechanics of the game and see the effects of different variables.
# End-Bringer Mode
In this mode, you play the role of a spy who infiltrated the town.
Your goal is simple: Eradicate the people of this town.
You have a budget provided by your country, and you can use this budget to manipulate the variables of the virus.
Your country will continue to fund you based on how well you are doing on achieving your goal. 
# Savior Mode
In this mode, you are the mayor of the town.
Your goalis to free your town of the pandemic.
To achieveyour goal, you have to use your budget carefully. 
Your buget is mainly provided by the tax money from each person of the town.
Set up a epidemic control building to raise awareness about the epidemic.
The control building can also be a useful resource to generate money by selling merchindise,
however people who buy merchindise won't become more aware about the epidemic.
You can find a vaccine, which will make the population more resilliant to the virus.
After you find a vaccine, you can choose to make the vaccine free or paid. 
If the vaccine is free, more people will get the virus, however, you won't generate any money from vaccinations.
Your town may be infiltrated by spies.
These spies will manipulate the variables of the virus. 
You can ban by spending a portion of your budget, or you may leave them as is since the way the spies manipulate the virus may be beneficial for you.
